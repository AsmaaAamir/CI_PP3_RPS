## Bugs

## Deployment
### Heroku 

I used Heroky to deploye this application through GitGub. below are the step I took to deploye the appliction:

1. Create an account on herkou.com or sign in. 
2. Creat a new app, add your project name and choose your region then click creat app.  
3. Go to Setting and go to Config Vars - there you can put any files that is sensitive e.g (CREDS.json)
4. Then we need to add buildpacks, so click on Add build pack and choose python first and the nodejs. They have to in that order
5. Go to Deploy and at the Deplument method, click on Connect with Github. 
6. Then it will ask you to enter your repository name and once you find it click on it. 
7. Once connect it will ask you to choose the branch you want yo build you app from.
8. To make thing easy for you click Enable auTOMATIC deploys, this will keep the app up to date with your Github repository. 

### Forking the GitHub Repository

You can create a copy of the original repository to see or edit with out changing the original by forking on GitHub. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and search for the repository.
2. Click on Fork (its the last button on the top right of the repository page.)
3. Thus copy the repository in to your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to your GitHub account and find the repositroy taht your would like to clone
2. Then locate the Code button (It's the 3rd button on the right befor the GitPod button).
3. You will need to copy the HTTPS link and then open Git Bash. 
4. You would need to change the curent working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Then in the IDE'S terminal type 'git clone' then paste the URL link that you copied from HTTPS.
6. After pressing enter, that would have created your local clone.
